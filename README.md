For project entitled "Utilizing Machine Learning to Understand Biochemical Processes."
My partner and I explored the effects of various antioxidants on the oscillating Briggs-Rauscher reaction. We developed a quantitative method and determined the best experimental conditions for measuring antioxidant potential by writing a machine learning program in Python to analyze data and suggest new experimental conditions. 
This is that program.
